The 4th of March 2022, the Argentinian producer Bizarrap and the Puerto Rican rapper René Residente released the theme called BZRP Music Sessions #49, the 49th chapter of the series of collaborations known as sessions that the Argentinian producer is doing with international artists, mainly Hispanic. This last 9-minutes-long session has been the most controversial of all reaching to more than 17 million views in the release day, a total record in the Spanish-speaking community. The reason for this great impact is that, in this song, Residente retakes the beef he had with the Colombian artist JBalvin, that started in September 2021 when J Balvin wanted to discredit the Latin Grammy’s. Residente didn’t agree with this affirmation because he thought that it was disrespectful with a lot of artist that were nominated for the first time to these awards. Their battle was in standby until René Residente released this song in which he attacks the Colombian artist non-stop during 9 minutes, accusing him of doing everything for money and not being even capable of writing his own songs. 

It is because the great impact of this polarized event that we have decided to analyze how Twitter’s users have lived the new chapter of this battle between two very relevant artists of Hispanic music. 

## Data acquisition

It is used the educational toolkit, developed by Dr. Mariluz Congosto withing the Web Technologies Laboratory of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid to capture tweets and other Twitter related information related to certain event or topic. Such toolkit is named the **t-hoarder kit**.

## Data visualization

It is used **Gephi** to visualize the possible found networks. First we present a declared network with known artist or influencial people, in order to see if there is any interesting connection. Then a dynamic one is shown using the collected tweets. All the information is explained and presented in the file **report.pdf** and the used images are stored in the folder **images**.

All files employed during the work, from the t-hoarder kit as well as Gephi, are uploaded to the **files** folder, so you can reproduce the nets and the results.
